# League-of-Odds
Trying to identify the chance of victory for each team in a tournament

It was all written in python with Jupyter Notebook.
You will find my first attempt to predict matches results in "Odds to Win.ipynb".
If you want to see how I gathered this data, just look into the "Lol data addict.ipynb", just a warning, it is a complete MESS!!!

If you want to run your own predictions, you will find the CSV in the folder data/lol-2016. Don't forget to fork and send your modifications!
